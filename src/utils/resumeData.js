     about: "I am currently looking for an internship position for summer 2022. I have worked as a Software Engineer Trainee at IBM Accelerate Software Track and had an internship at StemAway. My experiences have given me experiences in full-stack development with web frameworks such as ReactJS, Ember.JS for front-end, and MongoDB and Node.js for back-end. I love to learn new stuff and apply the skills, especially in my field!"
